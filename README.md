Order to save energy and to use energy resources efficiently, automatic occupancy determination based on sensor information is performed and energy is adjusted according to the demand in a closed area. In this study is used records consisting of T (temperature), H (humidity), L (light level), CO2 (carbon dioxide) and R (humidity ratio) sensor data. With the use of PyCaret, four classifiers were chosen to use on the data: Decision Trees Classifier, KNN, Random Forest Classifier, and ADA-Boost. On both the original data set without tuning and with tuning, the ADA-Boost model performed the best. Classification algorithms along with PCA was also applied and Logistic regression performed the best among the other models. Finally, Shapley value is used to explain the prediction made by the ML classification models. 
 Key words: KNN, Explainable AI, Shapley Value, Decision Trees Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, ADA-Boost, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Machine Learning.
